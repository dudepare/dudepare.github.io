Hi! I am **Andrew Artajos**.

I am a software developer based in sunny Melbourne, Australia.

My previous work with ITRS Group involved C/C++ coding on real time monitoring software Geneos. I've used Python to do scripting work to implement extension plugins for Geneos.

I finished the course on Django the web framework for Python in MelbDjango school conducted by Common Code. Here's my final project deployed on Heroku: Introducing [JobOverflow](http://frozen-river-3647.herokuapp.com/)

*The illustration above is made by my daughter Lara. Everybody, I want to introduce you to Mr. Sun.*
