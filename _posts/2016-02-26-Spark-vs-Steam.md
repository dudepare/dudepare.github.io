title: Spark vs. Steam

There's always a new blog. This is the latest. I lost count already. I have started and abandoned so many blogs. 

Here's a list of my defunct blogs: *never mind clicking the links because they're all dead anyway*

* [Onehorsepower](http://onehorsepower.blogspot.com) My first ever blog.
* [The Freelanthropist](http://thefreelanthropist.blogspot.com) A blog that gives.
* [Dailybeater](http://dailybeater.wordpress.com) My watch blog. I am an aspiring [hodinkee](http://hodinkee.com) contributor.
* [Andoy.me](http://andoy.me) My more mature personal blog.
* Numerous blogs running locally on my home and office computers.

When I started each blog. It was like the only thing I wanted to do. Update it regularly even no one is reading. I believe I am the only one visiting those sites on a regular basis. Each one started with a spark -- but I did not have enough steam to maintain them. 

My github account is just another manifestation of this phenomenon. It's very easy to fork a new project. Read the documentation for getting started. Go through all the setup and installation process. But when it comes to contributing and actually spending time to dig deeper--finally make that pull request, the steam escapes me.

*I haven't figured out where to get the steam I need to stay on with a project. So far, I've been only experiencing sparks here and there. When I do find the steam -- I'll share it here or in a new blog I just started again.*
