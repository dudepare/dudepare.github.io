I am taking a stab at web development. Currently I am working with a python backend and a javascript front end. I am definitely struggling with my Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

To be able to be a good web developer, I should understand the basics of the web. This I know from reading Mozilla's Developer Network. So, I am starting my web development journey there. I want to start out right by reading up on HTML, CSS and finally JavaScript.

I do want to start from JavaScript then moving my way to HTML. The only way to learn these stuff is to create websites--starting from static websites then moving toward creating dynamic websites. I have a long way to go, as long as I stay the course, I will get there. 

I don't learn this stuff out of my own free will. In the sense I am a capitalist as well. I am investing my time here so I could reap the rewards later. I want to upskill so I could fetch more money while I do my job. A great one at that.
