I am on a self-educating journey. Every step of the way, I try to learn and execute. I make a lot of mistakes which translates directly to failures. I miss out a lot on opportunities but I'm preparing myself even more to get those opportunities that matter.

I am a long time mediocre programmer. Now that I migrated into a first world country, that couldn't be even more pronounced. I am stuck in a job that is not ideal. Now, I'm getting all the technical books I can grab my hands on and learn from it. I just bought two books:

1. Test Driven Development with Python
2. Cracking the Coding Interview

These books will be my bestfriend for the remaining months of 2016. I want to achieve mastery for both topics. When I attained that, I will be ready for my new job that pays well. That's the goal.
