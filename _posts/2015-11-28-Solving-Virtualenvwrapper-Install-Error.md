title: Solving virtualenvwrapper install error

Problem on virtualenvwrapper.

* I uninstalled pip2 and pip3.
* I made sure that the python default version is python2
* I made a fresh install of pip for python2
* There is no pip for python3 installed in the global environment
* pip3 is alive within virtualenvs only.
