Thank you for Jekyll and Github I have a new blog. 

I am not used to this kind of blogging platform where your text editor is where you write your posts. No fancy web based gui as found in Ghost and Wordpress. They are great blogging platforms but there's always a new one that is out to get a slice of the market share.

I find the Jekyll default theme butt-ugly. I needed something more pleasing to the eye. But then my HTML and CSS skills are at its infancy. All I can do is find a better theme out there and modify it to my liking.

# Jekyll-now
I found Jekyll-now through a quick google search which led me to the smashing magazine article: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Smashing magazine is a very trusted source so this content should be good. I tried it out. It looked better than the original theme. 

I made a few tweaks to suit my needs and uploaded it to my github blog. Thank you to Barry Clark for his article and the jekyll-now theme. Now, I'm seeing the benefits of github and open source.

# Changes
Here's a list of the changes I've made:
* title's font to Google Fonts' Open Sans 
* changed font color of the title
* body copy is in Merriweather
* removed the avatar
* removed the blog description
* capitalised the menu items
* updated the about page
* moved the blog post date right below the blog post title 

# Source
Revisions can be seen at my [github](https://github.com/dudepare/dudepare.github.io).

*With just a few tweaks my new blog is now handsome.*
