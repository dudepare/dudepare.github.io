I finally completed a working development environment of DXR. 

DXR is the tool Mozilla uses to search for file and functions for every mozilla project codebase. 

I consider this a big leap forward for me because I have been working at this for quite sometime now. Ever since I decided to play with open source code when I arrived here in Australia. The only thing that changed from my failed attempts until now is a reliable unilimited broadband internet. As I have learned internet is a bit expensive here. I used to rely on a prepaid wifi broadband service and it costs around 50 AUD for a meager 10GB of data. 

To setup a fully working DXR, you have to download vagrant, virtual box and the virtual box image where the project will run. That alone would set you back a lot of dollars. I tried to move forward using the local library's internet connection but I have to drive there and work only during the operational hours of the library. At first I thought it's ok to work right outside the library as long as I'm still connected to the wifi. I learned the wifi connection goes too when the library closes. Ho hum.

I consider this a very big step for me in the open source world. I want to learn, contribute and just start working on a really interesting open source project that I might not have any opportunity in an office setting.  

I want to congratulate the DXR team for making it easy for newbies like me to setup a new dev environment from scratch with very minimal steps that just works.

On a side note. I wanted to write this because I am very happy to make the damn thing work.

Yesterday I was listening to Tim Ferriss' podcast featuring Maria Popova of [brainpickings.org](http://brainpickings.org). She said I should write for myself and no one else. Once I consider my writing to cater for a reader or for anybody else--it will affect the output.
