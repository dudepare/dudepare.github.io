> Make one function work, then work on the others

I was writing two functions with similar functionality at the same time. I was trying to make both work editing code in two different places. I figured out it is much easier to work on one then apply what I learned to the next function. Better yet, re-factor the code so that there is one common code then pass in parameters instead.
