I can't let this day pass without posting something. It will be another 4 year wait until the next 29 of February. 

I just want to reflect on today's events and accomplishments. This day started good because early in the day I was able to accomplish a lot of errands and work related tasks without any major hurdles. 

* Shopped for much needed paper plates -- because we don't use real plates anymore to save time washing the dishes. I am sure this is just temporary for us because we are allotting time where we need it the most.

* Shopped for fruits and essentials as well. This month was though for all of our family members because almost every one got sick. That's why I'm loading up on healthy food: fruits mostly and greens. 

I also take pro-biotics to enhance my immune system as recommended by my mom. I do try get as much sleep as I can despite the household chores that never ends really.

I also got a 10 dollar discount off my bill--thank you flybuys for that. I paid a total of $2 for all of the stuff I bought. If you don't have flybuys, get one.

* I'm happy to solve the database migration errors at work. Come to think of it, the fixes were pretty simple really. I remember before I knew how to fix it I was very anxious and stressed out about it. It is such a foreign concept to me--SQL and database migrations. In time I was able to figure things out with the help of some colleagues.

* My leave is approved for the month of March. I'm very happy about this because this time is reserved for a very much needed family time.

* I did some very minor cardio workout by getting off the train one station earlier and walked the distance to our office. 

* Shaved my face clean.

* Followed up on our electricity provider. We now have power in our new place. #oh yeah

* Topped up my myki.

These are just little things if you think about it--but these little things make up your life. Each day it will be different things but they build up on one another quickly as each day goes by. 

*I am positive I'll end the rest of the day leaping for joy when I get out of the office. I am very excited to flip the main switch in our house and see it light up in the night.*
