This is part of my practice programming in Python. The exercise for today is Strings! 

So given two strings.

  s1 = "ADFFCCFFVDFEFF"
  s2 = "FF"

Count the number of occurrences of s2 in s1. This is a fairly simple problem that can be solved in a number of ways. I started creating a solution for the problem and I came up with a recursive solution. 

## Recursive approach

    def countOccurrence(source, key):
    
        # stop when our source string is shorter than our key
        if len(source) < len(key):
            return 0
      
      # extract the front part of the string with the same length as the key 
      head = source[:len(key)]
  
      # shorten our source string by one until we get to our base case
      if head == key:
          return 1 + countOccurrence(source[1:], key)
      else:
          return 0 + countOccurrence(source[1:], key)
        
  
## Iterative approach
  
    def countOccurrence(source, key):
      count = 0
      end = len(source) - len(key)
      for i in range(end+1):
          head = source[i:i+len(key)]
          print(head, i)
          if head == key:
              count += 1
      return count

> Although both approaches work. I was more comfortable doing the recursive approach as it was more intuitive.
