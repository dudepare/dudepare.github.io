I just come across this ad on twitter. It's definitely a coding opportunity so why not give it a go?

This is the solution I came up with.

## hired.py

    def main(msg):
    	convert = map(chr, msg)
    	print("".join(list(convert)))
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
    	msg = [76, 101, 116, 116, 104, 101, 98, 101, 115, 116, 115, 116, 97, 114, 116,117, 112, 115, 97, 112, 112, 108, 121, 116, 111, 121, 111, 117, 0]
    	main(msg)

## Output

`Letthebeststartupsapplytoyou`

I just thought it was interesting to decode the message.
