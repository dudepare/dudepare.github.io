I just went back to school yesterday. I attended Common Code's free Django classes called MelbDjango. I found out about this through [Meetup](http://meetup.com). 

The MelbDjango school is run by Common Code, taught by Brenton Cleeland. This runs for nine weeks every Thursday. It started yesterday 16th July 2015. I am lucky enough to know about this. All you have to do is show up at : Common Code every Thursday 05:30 PM. The first meeting ran for an hour and the succeeding meetings will be for two hours.

# Lesson one

[Introduction to Django](http://melbdjango.github.io/lesson-one/)

We just finished lesson one. It was a quick one. The lecture was fast paced. Good thing I was able to make the presentation run on my local machine, then I got to follow the installation process. 

# Stoked
It's not too late to join the class. If you read through lesson one, you can still catch up on the next session.

I am excited to get active and do all the stuff in this class. I am doing my best to document everything here. This is my first foray into web programming. Let's develop the web.
