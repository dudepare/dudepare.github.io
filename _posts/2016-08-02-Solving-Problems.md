As a programmer, my task is to solve problems through code. When I can solve problems with code efficiently and as consistently as possible, then I am an effective programmer.

This task is not easy to do, let alone not easy to do correctly and swiftly. This is what coding challenges expects you to do. Pick a random problem, throw it to the applicant and give him a slim time limit to solve it. Finally, put the code through a rigorous test suite.

Thus far, this is my biggest hurdle in landing a job. Yes, I read always be coding @ medium. It is a wonderful article. Very hard to do consistently in practice. I just want to know how to solve a lot of programming problems. Get into that train of thinking so that when you throw a new problem to me, I'll know how to attack it. So far, I haven't reached that point yet.

I bought this book. I'll invest a good amount of time in it understanding how to solve each and every problem discussed in there. I hope to get good at solving problems in reading this book. The end is landing a great job.

This is the task at hand. It is the start of the month of August. By September I will be in a different position. My problem solving skills has evolved by leaps and bounds. This is my ticket to an awesome new programming gig. Who knows an opensource project developer is not that far away as well.
