I have this video downloaded and saved in my phone to teach myself the basics of Sqlalchemy. 

## Why? 

* I wanted to know how to use it for the project I'm currently working on.

* I wanted to create unittests for the existing models I have. 

* How does it differ to the Django ORM I am more familiar with?

These are fairly straight forward goals that this video help answer.

Good job to the presenter of this. It makes me crave for cookies as well.
